## Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Scrum Master currently working at [Expeditors](https://www.expeditors.com/) and exploring augmented reality development on the side.  I'm a graduate of the Penn State [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu).

I'm currently developing projects to hone my skills in Unity and C#, and I'm interested in exploring new applications of augmented reality.   I've also done work in Python to automate work item tracking for my Scrum teams using the Azure DevOps REST API.
